Backup your /Applications/MAMP/conf/ dir.

Generate a (dummy) SSL Certificate

$ cd ~

# generate a private key (will request a password twice)
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024

# generate certificate signing request (same password as above)
$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

# Answer the questions
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: DC
Locality Name (eg, city) []: Washington
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: HBX
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: Development
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: localhost
Email Address []: your_email@domain.com
A challenge password []: # leave this empty
An optional company name []: # leave this empty

# generate the certificate
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

# remove the password from the server key
$ cp server.key server.tmp
$ openssl rsa -in server.tmp -out server.key

#create .pem file for xcode
$ openssl x509 -in server.crt -out server.pem -outform pem

# Move the certificate into your MAMP apache configuration folder
$ cp server.crt /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache
$ cp server.key /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache
Open /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf and uncomment Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-ssl.conf.

Keep your vhost in /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf just the same.

In /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-ssl.conf, find the following block and edit the fields Server Name and Document Root with the values you already have in your vhost.

#   General setup for the virtual host
DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/Library/htdocs"
ServerName www.example.com:443
ServerAdmin you@example.com
ErrorLog "/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/error_log"
TransferLog "/Applications/MAMP/Library/logs/access_log"
and edit in your DocumentRoot and ServerName settings:
